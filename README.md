# tictactoe
A javascript file to check a tic tac toe board for win conditions. This should work regardless of how big the gameboard is.

NOTE: This does not perform checks on the gameboard for garbage values. It assumes that the only valid characters on the board are '', 'x', and 'o'. It also assumes that the number of rows and columns on the board are equal. And, since I'm new to javascript, there are no tests as of yet. I ran this code through https://playcode.io/ to check its function.
